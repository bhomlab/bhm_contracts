1) Safe withdraw by owner

```bash
  function withdraw() onlyOwner public {
  	require(state != State.Active);
  	uint256 balance = deposit.balance;
    owner.transfer(balance);  
  }
```

//TODO
2) Safe withdraw by claimer

```bash
  function withdrawByClaimer() public {
  	require(state != State.Active);
  	require();
  	uint256 balance = deposit.balance;
    claimer.transfer(balance);  
  }
```

3) 

1.2.2 User Level Policy

As level of user, only user who has authority can do specific action.

1) Add Admin By Controller 

```bash
  modifier onlyController {
   require(msg.sender == controller);
    _;
  }

  function addAdmin(address _addr, bool _value) onlyController public {
    require(_addr != address(0));
    require(admin[_addr] == !_value);
    admin[_addr] = _value;
  }
```



2) Add Certified Agent By Admin

```bash
  mapping (address => bool) public certifiedAgent;
  
  modifier onlyAdmin() {
    require(admin[msg.sender]);
    _;
  }

  function addCertifiedAgent(address _addr, bool _value) onlyAdmin public {
    require(_addr != address(0));
    require(admin[_addr] == !_value);
    certifiedAgent[_addr] = _value;
  }
```

3) Confirmation By Certified Agent

```bash
  modifier onlyCertifiedAgent {
   require(certifiedAgent[msg.sender]);
    _;
  }

  function confirmByCA(address _contractAddress, address _owner) onlyCertifiedAgent public {
    require(_addr != address(0));
    AuctionStructs[_owner]._contractAddress.auctionEnd();
  }
```

1.2.3 Cancel Function with Refund

Cancellation can be done before transaction finished. If transaction cancelled, owner of deposit can withdraw from vault. 


1.2.4 Common Information of Real Estate

4) Type of transaction 


#### 1.3. Exceptional Case

#### 2.2. function description

2.2.1 Deposit

See 1.2.1

2.2.2 Creation

//TODO 생성 시에 BHM 컨트랙 주소를 등록하고 거기서 CA임을 확인한다?
Transaction smart contract created by owner. Owner is 'Who want to sell real estate'. When initiating, BHM Token contract address must be saved in transaction smart contract.

```bash
  function Auction(uint _biddingTime, address _beneficiary ) public {
    tokenAddress = msg.sender;
    beneficiary = _beneficiary;
    auctionEnd = _biddingTime;
  }
```

2.2.3 Winner

Highest bidder will be winner of the auction. When bidding, token saved in deposit. If highest bidder appear, other bidders can withdraw their tokens.

```bash    
  function auctionEnd() public {     
     require(now >= auctionEnd); 
     require(!ended); 
     ended = true;
     AuctionEnded(highestBidder, highestBid);
     beneficiary.transfer(highestBid);
  }
```

2.2.4 Bidding by BHM

BHM과 deposit의 관계 문제...
minime token에 lock unlock을 넣어야 할듯?
예치금 납부를 셀프로 해서 컨트랙에 넣어두고 빼가고 하면 될듯?

//TODO
컨트롤러를 넘겨야 할 수도 있다.
Highest bidder가 나타나면 withdraw가 가능해진다.
